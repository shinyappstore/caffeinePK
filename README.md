# caffeinePK: Caffeine PK Concentration Predictor

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/caffeinePK](https://shinyappstore.com/a/caffeinePK)__

caffeinePK stands as a potent application built upon the robust R package, caffsim, with its primary focus on predicting and calculating plasma caffeine concentration and pharmacokinetic parameters. Caffeine, a naturally occurring central nervous system stimulant found in coffee, cocoa beans, and tea leaves, has seen increased consumption. The caffsim R package, integral to caffeinePK, facilitates understanding how plasma caffeine concentration evolves over time and the duration of toxic concentrations in caffeine-sensitive groups. This tool is especially valuable for clinical evaluations, providing insights into the relationship between caffeine intake and potential toxicities when acute symptoms arise. Currently, there's a lack of a quantitative and interactive tool for predicting plasma caffeine concentrations that may lead to intoxication, making caffeinePK a crucial development in this regard. published: Han et al.
